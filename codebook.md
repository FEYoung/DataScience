1.	Experiment design

	There were 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19 - 48 years of age.

	Each volunteer was asked to complete the following activities one after the other in this order:
	
		sit down from a standing position, 
		stand up from the sitting position, 
		asked to lay down on a table from a standing position,
		walk along a long corridor, 
		descend 20 stairs, 
		ascend 20 stairs.
	
	The code for each task is defined here:

	1.	WALKING
	2. 	WALKING_UPSTAIRS (20 stairs to climb)
	3. 	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (20 stairs to descend)
	4. 	SITTING (sitting down in a chair)
	5. 	STANDING (standing up from a sitting position)
	6. 	LAYING
	
	Two sets of data were taken: training and test. A number of volunteers were selected for the two tasks.
	
	Test data:	30% or 9 of the 30 volunteers were selected for this task.
	Training data: 	70% or 21 of the 30 volunteers were selected for this task.
