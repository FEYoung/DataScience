#MODULE 10 - CAPSTONE PROJECT

"The capstone project class will allow students to create a usable/public data product that can be used to show your skills to potential employers. Projects will be drawn from real-world problems and will be conducted with industry, government, and academic partners."

-------------------------------

COURSE TASKS

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

    Understanding the problem
    Data acquisition and cleaning
    Exploratory analysis
    Statistical modeling
    Predictive modeling
    Creative exploration
    Creating a data product
    Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

You will hear about each of these tasks over the course of the capstone.

ASSESSMENT AND GRADING

To successfully complete the capstone project, you must receive a passing grade on all of the following assignments:

    Quiz 1: Getting Started
    Milestone Report: exploratory analysis of the data set + evaluation of at least three classmate submissions
    Quiz 2: Natural Language Processing I
    Quiz 3: Natural Language Processing II
    Final Project: your data product and a presentation describing your final data product + evaluation of at least three classmate submissions

The quizzes will be standard multiple choice quizzes. The other components are graded by peer evaluation.

YOUR FINAL GRADE will be calculated as follows

    Quiz 1 - 5%
    Milestone Report - 20%
    Quiz 2 - 10%
    Quiz 3 -10%
    Final Project - 55%

COURSE DATASET

This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the link below and not from external websites to start.

INSTRUCTIONS

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the word prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

    A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
    
    A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

--------------------------------

REVIEW CRITERIA

SHINY APP ALGORITHM

    Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?
    
    Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
    
    When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
    
    Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?

PRESENTATION SLIDES

    Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
    
    Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?
    
    Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
    
    How would you describe the experience of using this app?
    
    Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
    
    Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?
